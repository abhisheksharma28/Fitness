    	<p><h2>BY AMY RUSHLOW AND EMILY SHIFFER</h2><br>
If you're looking to build muscle, boost your performance, and make the most out of all your hard work in the gym, whey protein is the way to go.
Smart guys don't build up supplement stacks based off hunches and the hard work of companies looking to sell their wares (although that certainly doesn't hurt). Research suggests that using whey protein powder along with resistance training can help maintain lean body mass and increase upper and lower-body strength. That's just the start of the benefits you can get from the powdery stuff — studies performed on mice suggest whey protein could improve performance, too.
But walk through the aisles of any supplement store, and you'll see a wide variety of different protein types. So why whey? One of the major benefits of using whey protein is that it contains a wide range amino acids not seen in plant-based protein products, like pea or hemp proteins, says Marie Spano M.S.,sports nutritionist for the Atlanta Hawks, Braves, and Falcons.
"With any plant-based protein, it's not a complete protein," Spano says. "It doesn't have all amino acids necessary for muscle growth and repair."The ease of protein powder lends itself to on-the-go options like shakes, but you can use it to boost the protein content of real food, too. When it comes to incorporating whey protein into meals, Spano suggests adding it into foods like yogurt or oatmeal because the moisture makes for easier integration. She also recommends combining whey with foods like peanut butter that have significant fat content, since that helps compensate for the drying effects that whey protein sometimes has.
There is also an abundance of essential amino acids in whey protein, one of which is leucine. Leucine is needed to 'turn on' muscle building at a cellular level, according to Mike Roussell, Ph.D., author of The Meta Shred Diet.
But keep in mind — you need to put in the work in the gym for your whey protein powder to actually help you build muscle. “It is important to note that whey protein alone won't lead to muscle building," Roussell notes. "In order to build muscle you need to be in a calorie surplus (eating more calories than you are burning) and consuming ample total protein (1g/lb body weight).”
Any 100 percent whey protein powder should give you a good boost. But for even more targeted body benefits, check out this list of whey powders. (Not sure what all that jargon on your bottle of whey means? Click here for our Protein Label Decoder.)</p></div>
